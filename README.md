# Manage Offenders - Prototypes
Prototypes for the "manage offenders in custody" service, using the [GOV.UK prototype kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit).

There are other prototypes at https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-moic-prototype. It would be good to bring these together!

## Get started
